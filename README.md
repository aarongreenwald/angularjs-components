Reusable Directives and other stuff for AngularJS apps

## agNavigableTable

Allows you to use arrow keys to navigate inputs in a table. Add it to the the tbody or table element in your table and you're done.
You will be able to navigate the input boxes in a table using arrow keys. See the demo app for details.

###Future

--I would like to add support for more than just inputs - contenteditable divs, textareas, etc. 
--There should be an option to allow the ENTER key to behave like the down arrow (as in MS Excel)
